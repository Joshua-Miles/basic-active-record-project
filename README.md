# Basic ActiveRecord Project

* Create a users table with a name column
* Run the app using `ruby app.rb`
* The app should ask for a users name
* The app should check to see if there is already a user with that name
* If there is, the app should puts "Welcome back, #{name}"
* If there isn't the app should create a user with that name, and puts "Welcome, "#{name}"
